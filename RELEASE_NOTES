         * modify the scanner code on MAIN_TRUNK in order to pass 
           the loop frequency as a parameter. 
           You can now pass the frequency in Hz with the option "-f", 
           for example for a 100Hz loop you will:
           [ scanner -f 100 .... ]
           It defaults to 1kHz if no value is passed, 
           A minimum of 1 Hz and a maximum of 10 kHz are the limits
