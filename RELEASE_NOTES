--------------------------------------------------
ethercat-R4-3_1-2: 2016-03-03 J. Vasquez
        * Changed the scanner hardcode RT priority from 60 to 40
          on file ethercatApp/scannerSrc/scanner.c
          40 is selected to lower than the network RT thread for eth1.
          eth1 is the interface used by Ethercat

ethercat-R4-3_1-1: 2016-02-24: Done by Jesus
         * modify the scanner code on MAIN_TRUNK in order to pass 
           the loop frequency as a parameter. 
           You can now pass the frequency in Hz with the option "-f", 
           for example for a 100Hz loop you will:
           [ scanner -f 100 .... ]
           It defaults to 1kHz if no value is passed, 
           A minimum of 1 Hz and a maximum of 10 kHz are the limits

ethercat-R4-3_1-0: 2016-02-17 E. Williams
	* Integrated ethercat version 4-3 into SLAC environment
